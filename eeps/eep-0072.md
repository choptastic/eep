EEP 72: Reserved words and Variables as record names, and enhancement to definition syntax
----

Abstract
========

This EEP loosens some of the restrictions around record names to make it
no longer necessary to quote them when they are named with reserved
words (`#if` vs `#'if'`) or words with capitalized first characters (`#Hello`
vs `#'Hello'`).

This EEP also proposes to add a new record-like syntax to the record
definitions (also adopting the above syntactical changes), such that the
following record definitions would all be valid and identical:

```erlang
-record('div', {a :: integer(), b :: integer()}).
-record #'div'{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}.
-record #div{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}.
```
The latter two are proposed new syntax.  The following would also be valid
and identical since parentheses are optional in attributes:

```erlang
-record 'div', {a :: integer(), b :: integer()}.
-record(#'div'{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}).
-record(#div{a :: integer(), b :: integer()}).
```
Motivation
==========

Record names are atoms. As such, the current Erlang syntax requires the record
names to be consistent with the rest of the language's use of atoms.

All atoms in Erlang can be denoted with single-quotes. Some examples:

For example:
```erlang
'foo'.
'FOO'.
'foo-bar'.
```

But, conveniently, simple atoms (all alphanumeric, underscores (`_`) or
at-symbols (`@`) with the first character being a lower-case letter and not one
of the 20+ reserved words), in all contexts can be invoked without the
necessary wrapping quotes. Some examples:

```erlang
foo.
foo_Bar.
'foo-bar'. % still quoted since the term has a non-atomic character in it.
```

Conveniently, this also means that records named with simple atoms can be
invoked and used without having to quote the atoms. For example:

```erlang
-record(foo, {a, b}).

go() ->
    X = #foo{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#foo{a = something_else},
    Z = Y#foo.a,
    ...
```

Unfortunately, that also means that records named with anything that doesn't
fit the "simple atom" pattern must be wrapped in quotes in definition and
usage. For example:

```erlang
-record('div', {a, b}).

go() ->
    X = #'div'{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#'div'{a = something_else},
    Z = Y#'div'.a,
    ...
```

While this approach is consistent with atom usage in the language, for reserved
words, this makes the record syntax *feel* inconsistent if you have a need for
naming a record with a reserved word (or term with a capital first letter).  In
this case, it almost guarantees a user won't use a record named 'if',
'receive', 'fun', etc even though there may very well be a valid use-case for
such a name.  The most common use-case that comes to mind from the Nitrogen Web
Framework.  Since HTML has a `div` tag, Nitrogen (which represents HTML tags
using Erlang records) should naturally have a `#div` record, however, due to
'div' being a reserved word, the record `#panel` is used instead to save the
programmer from having to invoke `#'div'`, which feels unnatural and awkward.

Specification
=============

This EEP simplifies the above example by

1. Allowing reserved words and variables to be used without quotes for record
   names, and
2. Simplifying the definition such that the syntax between record definition
   and record usage becomes more consistent.

With the changes from this EEP, the above code becomes:

```erlang
-record #div{a, b}.

go() ->
    X = #div{a = 1, b = 2},
    Y = X#div{a = something_else},
    Z = Y#div.a,
    ...
```

Implementation
==============

To update the syntax for using records, we can safely augment the parser to
change `# atom` to `# record_name` and define `record_name` to be either
`atom`, `var`, or `reserved_word`.

To update the record definition syntax, we can simply add a few new
modifications to the `attribute` Nonterminal.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As this EEP only adds new syntax, the vast majority existing codebases will
still work, with the possible exception of AST/code analysis tools that are
analyzing code using the new syntax.

Syntax highlighting and code-completion tools may need to be updated to support
the new syntax if your code uses the new syntax rules.
